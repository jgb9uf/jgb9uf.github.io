He decides that whatever the cost, he will be free. Libertatem, sive mors. Or maybe he'll just see what, in the name of science and industry, this wee beastie has to offer in the way of fun. \n\nTurns out this is only slightly better than licking toads. \n\nHe is able to record his thoughts on his iphone, which, rescued from the primordial soup, proves sufficient. \n\nAnd shut up about the hiss. I know about the stupid tape hiss. My 1997 space portal CD burner died, give a fella a break. The break broke the bastard, as it were. One tune deep. \n\nSo fuck off already. \n\nLove and snuggles, \nDr. Love Doctor, esq.\ncredits\n\nLeo: Yay \nMike: Nay \nTY: Stuck in the driveway\n",

On Thursday mornin', Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland- baseball player, boatswain's mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up... \nbobbed up and down in the water just like a kinda top. Upended. \nWell... \nhe'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. Young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper. Anyway, he saw us and come in low and three hours later, a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. \n\nY'know, that was the time I was most frightened, waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a life jacket again. So, eleven hundred men went into the water, three hundred sixteen men come out, and the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945. \n\nI value my neck a lot more than three thousand bucks, chief...",
